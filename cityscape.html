        Cityscape
        <p><br>Architecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the 
            metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive 
            firebombing in World War II. Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern 
            and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce. Tokyo features many internationally 
            famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode 
            Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo also features two 
            distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both 
            Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. 
            Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which is set to be finished in March 
            2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).</p><br>
        <p>Tokyo also contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo 
            Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.</p>
