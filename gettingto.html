        Getting to Tokyo
        <ul type="none"><br>
            <li>By Plane
                <p>Direct flights to Narita and Haneda are the most common ways to access the country. Once you 
                    arrive, you can jump on an express train or Limousine bus that will transport you into the 
                    heart of the city. Please check these pages on Narita Airport and Haneda Airport for more 
                    information.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, you can fly into Kansai International Airport (KIX) or Chubu Centrair 
                    International Airport, Nagoya from abroad. These airports are great access points for 
                    exploring areas such as Kyoto, Osaka, Ise, and Takayama, before visiting the capital. You 
                    can easily take a domestic flight to Tokyo from these two airports, as well as a host of 
                    other local airports that are dotted around the country. An increasing number of budget 
                    airlines offer fares at very wallet-friendly prices.</p>    
            </li><br>
            <li>By Cruise Ship
                <p>The Tokyo International Cruise Terminal started operating in September 2020. The terminal is 
                    able to accommodate the largest cruise ships in the world. If you are planning to visit 
                    Tokyo during a cruise, there are taxis, trains and buses that can easily take you into the 
                    city for sightseeing. Also, the terminal is only five minutes away by car from Odaiba, a 
                    popular tourist destination and entertainment hub. For those boarding a cruise, the terminal 
                    is easily accessible from Narita and Haneda airports.</p>
            </li><br>
            <li>By Train
                <p>The shinkansen (bullet train) is another option for accessing Tokyo from other cities around 
                    the country. From Kagoshima in the southern island of Kyushu to Hakodate in the northern 
                    island of Hokkaido, a network of sleek and speedy express trains criss-cross the country 
                    providing you with a quick and easy travel option to Tokyo.</p>
            </li><br>
            <li>By Ferry
                <p>If you want a more unique experience coming into Tokyo, try coming by ferry. It's best to 
                    prepare a plan in advance to make the most of a day near the piers. Take a look at the 
                    Walks and Tours section for some ideas. Whether you are a first-time visitor or a Tokyo 
                    regular, our itineraries will help you make the most of your Tokyo adventure.</p>
            </li><br>
            <li>By Express Bus
                <p>Japan's long-distance express buses offer a cheaper way into the city and across the country. 
                    If you're looking to save some money and are used to long bus rides, you may want to consider 
                    taking an express bus. They can be more comfortable than you think. Many buses come equipped 
                    with electric outlets and reclining chairs. For overnight journeys, there are usually 
                    additional amenities such as blankets and pillows. Some bus operators even offer more 
                    luxurious options, like privacy curtains and extra legroom. The biggest hub for bus travel 
                    in Tokyo is the Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal.</p>
