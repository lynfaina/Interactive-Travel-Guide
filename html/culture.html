            Tokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for 
            traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the 
            Kabuki-za for Kabuki. Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and 
            traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the 
            performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama. Tokyo also hosts modern 
            Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to 
            internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.

            Many different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the 
            Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with 
            elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an 
            enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry 
            blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku 
            Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.

            Cuisine in Tokyo is internationally acclaimed. In November 2007, Michelin released their first 
            guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's 
            nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). 
            Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two 
            stars, and 161 earned one star.
