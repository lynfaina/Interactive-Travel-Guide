            Tokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan’s largest domestic and international 
            hub for rail and ground transportation. However, its airspace has been under the US military’s 
            exclusive control after World War II. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an 
            extensive network of “clean and efficient” trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with 
            buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines 
            and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo. Shibuya Crossing is the “world’s busiest pedestrian 
            crossing”, with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.

            As a result of World War II, Japanese planes are generally forbidden to fly over Tokyo. Therefore, 
            Japan constructed airports outside Tokyo. Narita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the 
            major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as 
            All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at Ōta, offers 
            domestic and international flights. As of 2018, some flight routes into Haneda are permitted through 
            Tokyo airspace.

            Various islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachijō-jima (Hachijojima Airport), 
            Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu Ōshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo 
            International and other airports.

            Rail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo, which has the most extensive urban railway 
            network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's 
            largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. 
            It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern 
            part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.

            Two different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the 
            governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private 
            carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are 
            available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and 
            Shinjuku.

            Expressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kantō region, and the 
            islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were 
            constructed above existing roads. Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special 
            wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry 
            passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.
