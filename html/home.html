        About Tokyo
        <p><br>(Note: This is a demo project and not an official site so the credit of all the information and

        <p>Tokyo, officially the Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital and largest city of Japan. Formerly known as 
            Edo, its metropolitan area (spanning 13,452 square kilometres or 5,194 square miles) is the most 
            populous in the world, with an estimated 37.468 million residents as of 2018; the city proper has 
            a population of 13.99 million people. Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, the prefecture forms part 
            of the Kantō region on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. Tokyo serves as Japan's 
            economic centre and is the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.</p><br>
        <p>Originally a fishing village named Edo, the city became a prominent political centre in 1603, when 
            it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the most 
            populous cities in the world with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji 
            Restoration of 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, which was renamed "Tokyo" 
            (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). Tokyo was devastated by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, and again by 
            Allied bombing raids during World War II. Beginning in the 1950s, the city underwent rapid 
            reconstruction and expansion efforts, going on to lead the Japanese economic miracle. Since 1943, 
            the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's 23 special wards (formerly 
            Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island 
            chains known as the Tokyo Islands.</p><br>
        <p>Tokyo is the largest urban economy worldwide by gross domestic product, and is categorized as an 
            Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. It is also Japan's leading 
            centre of business and finance as part of an industrial region that includes the cities of 
            Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2021, Tokyo is home to 37 companies of the Fortune Global 
            500. In 2020, the city ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index, behind only New York 
            City, London, and Shanghai. Tokyo is home to the world's tallest tower, the Tokyo Skytree, and 
            the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer 
            Underground Discharge Channel (located in Kasukabe, Saitama, a suburb of Tokyo). The Tokyo Metro 
            Ginza Line, opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.</p><br>
        <p>The city has hosted multiple international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 
            Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics (postponed; held in 2021), 
            and three summits of the G7 (in 1979, 1986, and 1993). Tokyo is an international centre leading 
            research and development in Japan and is likewise represented by several major universities, most 
            notably including the University of Tokyo. The Tokyo Station is the central hub for Japan's 
            high-speed railway network, the Shinkansen; the Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is also the world's 
            busiest train station. Notable special wards of Tokyo include: Chiyoda, the site of the National 
            Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace; Shinjuku, the city's administrative centre; and 
            Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub.</p>
